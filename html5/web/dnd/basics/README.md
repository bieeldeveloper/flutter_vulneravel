## Basic Drag and Drop

A port of the Drag and Drop example used in the
[Native HTML5 Drag and Drop](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/dnd/basics/)
article by Eric Bidelman, originally published on HTML5Rocks.

HTML5 Drag and drop (DnD) is event-based way of making an element draggable
on a page. Native browser support for this feature means faster, more responsive
web apps.

This project demonstrates a very simple example of deferred loading.

The breakfast.dart, lunch.dart, and dinner.dart libraries (in /lib)
are loaded lazily, when the user clicks the **Breakfast menu**,
**Lunch menu**, or **Dinner menu** buttons in the browser, respectively.

For more information, see the language tour's
[deferred loading section](https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/language-tour#lazily-loading-a-library).
